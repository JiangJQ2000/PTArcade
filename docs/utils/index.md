PTArcade is shipped with three utilities modules aimed at facilitating 
the creation of model files, as well as loading and analyzing the MCMC
chains produced by PTArcade. 

While detailed documentation for the content of these modules can be found in 
the [Reference][ref] section, in the next sections we give a high-level overview
of the utility modules.
