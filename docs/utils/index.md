PTArcade is shipped with three utility modules aimed at facilitating 
the creation of model files, as well as loading and analyzing the MCMC
chains produced by PTArcade. 

Detailed documentation for the content of these modules can be found in 
the [Reference][ref] section. In the next sections, we merely give a high-level overview
of these utility modules.
