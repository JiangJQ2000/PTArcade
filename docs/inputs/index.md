# Inputs

To [run PTArcade][run] you will need to provide two input files: 

* **[Model file][model]** : this is a Python file that containts the definition of the new-physics signal. In case of stochastic signals the signal is defined in terms of its 

$$
h^2\Omega(f)
$$

where we will define the GWB spectral shape and the prior distributions for the model parameters. 

!!! note "TOAs reference time"

    The TOAs are measured with respect to the reference time ...

* **[Configuration file][config]** : this file...

  [run]: ../run.md
  [model]: model.md
  [config]: config.md
